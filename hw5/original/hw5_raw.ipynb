        "* handle missing values and convert features to numeric values when it is needed\n",
        "* get rid of the unnecessary (which does not encode protein levels or the tumor type) columns and the CancerSEEK results\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Predict if a sample is cancerous or not\n",
        "\n",
        "* your need to build a classifier that predicts the probability of a sample coming from a cancerous (tumor type is normal or not) person based on the measured protein levels\n",
        "* train a logistic regression (sklearn API) on every second sample (not first 50% of the data (!), use every second line)\n",
        "* generate prediction for the samples that were not used during the training\n",

        "###  3. Comparision to CancerSEEK\n",

        "\n",
        "* fit a logistic regression (using statsmodels API this time) to predict if a sample has Hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) or not. You need to keep only the liver and the normal samples for this exercise! For fitting use only the first 25 features and all the rows (which are liver or normal)\n",

        "\n",
        "* Again, using every second datapoint train a logistic regression (sklearn API) to predict the tumor type. It is a multiclass classification problem.\n",

        "* Decorate your notebook with, questions, explanation etc, make it self contained and understandable!\n",
        "* Comments you code when necessary\n",
        "* Write functions for repetitive tasks!\n",
        "* Use the pandas package for data loading and handling\n",
        "* Use matplotlib and seaborn for plotting or bokeh and plotly for interactive investigation\n",
        "* Use the scikit learn package for almost everything\n",
        "* Use for loops only if it is really necessary!\n",
        "* Code sharing is not allowed between student! Sharing code will result in zero points.\n",
        "* If you use code found on web, it is OK, but, make its source clear!"
